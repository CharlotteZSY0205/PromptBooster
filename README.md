# Prompt Booster ‚Äî Product Design Document

## 1. Product Overview

**Prompt Booster** is a browser plugin/chat extension that helps users optimize their prompts when interacting with ChatGPT or other large language models. Users can either send their original prompt directly or click the **‚ÄúBoost Prompt‚Äù** button, which automatically rewrites their prompt into a higher-quality version and sends it without requiring further editing.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 One-Click Enhancement

* Two options when a user types a prompt:

  * **Send**: Send the original prompt.
  * **Boost Prompt**: Automatically rewrite the prompt and send the optimized version.

### 2.2 Multiple Modes (priority order)

1. **Learning Mode** (default)

   * Rewrites prompts to encourage **deep thinking, reflective thinking, and critical thinking**.
   * Adds reasoning steps, self-questioning, and comparison prompts to guide stronger engagement.
   * **Example**:

     * Original: *‚ÄúWrite me an essay about artificial intelligence.‚Äù*
     * Boosted (Learning Mode): *‚ÄúFirst, ask me 3 key questions to clarify my perspective. Then suggest two possible essay outlines with pros/cons, help me draft a thesis and evidence plan, and finally provide writing advice once I decide on a direction.‚Äù*

2. **Structured Mode**

   * Adds step-by-step instructions for clarity.
   * Example: request answers in bullet points, provide examples, then summarize.

3. **Concise Mode**

   * Keeps the original intent but rewrites the prompt to be shorter, clearer, and more precise.

4. **Creative Mode**

   * Expands prompts with brainstorming or divergent thinking elements.

### 2.3 History Comparison

* Chat history shows both versions:

  * Original prompt (small, gray text).
  * Optimized prompt (normal bubble).

### 2.4 Settings

* Default mode: Learning Mode.
* Users can switch modes in settings.
* Option to enable/disable ‚ÄúPreview before sending.‚Äù

## 5. Technical Architecture (high level, no code)

* **Processing Logic**: Sends the user‚Äôs prompt to a rewriting module, applies the selected mode, and returns an optimized prompt.
* **Compatibility**: First support ChatGPT web, expandable to Claude, Perplexity, and others.

## 6. Risks & Mitigation

* **User dissatisfaction with rewrite** ‚Üí Allow easy mode switching or revert to original prompt.
* **Unwanted interruptions** ‚Üí Option to always send the original prompt by default.
* **Mode overload** ‚Üí Keep UI simple: one Boost button, with mode settings tucked away.

## 7. MVP Requirements

1. Implement **Learning Mode** as the default.
2. One-click enhancement + auto-send workflow.
3. Display original vs. optimized prompts in chat history.
4. Support mode switching (Learning / Structured / Concise / Creative).

üëâ **Summary:**
This document positions Prompt Booster as a **user-facing productivity tool**, with **Learning Mode as the centerpiece** to encourage deeper thinking. The design emphasizes simplicity (one-click use), clear UX, and minimal configuration, making it straightforward for developers to build an MVP.
